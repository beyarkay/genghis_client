# Genghis Competitive Bot System - Client
## A bot-battling game system for coders
Genghis is a framework that allows bots built by Computer Science 
students compete for resources, trade, and fight each other across 
multiple different battlegrounds.

## Get started - Make Your Own Bot
To get started, you will need to copy some code from this GitHub repository into an 
internet-connected sever (like UCT's nightmare server that all second-year students 
have access to).

1. `ssh` into the UCT server:

    ```ssh <YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER>@nightmare.cs.uct.ac.za```
2. Make a public directory to host the bot script, and change into it:

    ```mkdir ~/public_html && cd ~/public_html```
3. Get a copy of the scripts needed to setup your bot, and then change into the newly created directory:

    ```git clone https://github.com/beyarkay/genghis_client.git && cd genghis_client```
4. Run a script to get you started (see next step about the prompts):

    ```python3 get_started.py```
5. At the prompts, enter the server's URL:

    ```https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~KNXBOY001/genghis_server```
6. your (Client) URL:

    ```https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~<YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER>/genghis_client```
7. and what you want your (one word) username to be:

    ```Username: <CHOOSE A USERNAME>```
    
    
All done! Your bot will be included in the next game. Email KNXBOY001 at myuct dot ac dot za 
with questions.

## Actually coding your bot
Please see the wiki for information about building your bot.
